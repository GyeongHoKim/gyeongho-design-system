Add a deterministic sketch-seed override so visual-regression snapshots are stable (GHD-45). `@ghds/sketch-core` now exports `forcedSeed()` / `setForcedSeed()`: when a host pins a seed, every adapter (`useSketch` in React/React Native, `SketchyBase` in web components) uses it instead of a random per-instance seed, making the hand-drawn geometry byte-identical across runs. Production and local dev are unchanged — the seed stays random unless explicitly pinned (e.g. by Storybook under Chromatic).
