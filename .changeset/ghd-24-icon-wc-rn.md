Add the `Icon` renderer to the remaining platforms (GHD-24). `@ghds/web-components` ships `<gh-icon name size label>` and `@ghds/react-native` ships `<Icon>`, both consuming the same `@ghds/icons` path data through `@ghds/sketch-core` with the deterministic per-name seed — so an icon looks identical across React, web components and React Native. Sizes come from `sys.icon.size`; color inherits `currentColor` (web) / defaults to `sys.color.icon.default` (RN).
